                                    The global purpose of the Gubkin University student chapter is to make the world we are living in better. One of the ways to reach this aim is to take part in the child-care organizations. In 2015 we decided to help children in the social-rehabilitation center situated in Tulskaya area. Every month we visit them and organize different cultural and entertainingprograms. The main idea of the project is to motivate such children to study hard, so one day they can enter any University they would like and start building their own future. Also we bring presents and sweets with us. We understand that it is just a small step, but we are working on making these steps greater.
