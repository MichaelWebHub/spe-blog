                        It goes without saying that currently there are about 400 SPE Student Chapters in the world but not all of them interact with each other. Having thought about it, we decided to start development of the new direction of activity which is aimed at the establishment of business relations with SPE Student Chapters of the world. The interaction will be built through organizing the joint web-conference to be attended by chapters from different countries and continents.
